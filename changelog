--------------

v0.2  21. Feb 2012

#General
+pdb2dx: Converts previously previously via dxTuber created pdb files back into OpenDX file format. Usefull if cavites shall be represented as 'surface' in VMD

#dxTuber_cmd
+supports now pdb(grid only) files as input
+fill after grouping (Experimental)
+minimum distance keep (mdk) applies an minimum distance filter and stores filtered ISV's separately for grouping // dirty dirty dirty ... 
+overlap option, switches if a ISV will be stored during scanning if a protein > protMinDens is located at the very same coordinates. 

#scanning / planesearch
+'--mdk' minimum distance keep, new idea to separate cavites inside water water clusters. 
-storeOverLappingISV = False    <--- switches if ISV will be deleted if a protein Voxels > protMinDens is located at the very same position 

#writepdb
-ungrouped cavities now have the (atom)id '0' instead of 'DEN' -> ungrouped cavities can be processed via analyzeCavity.py | dxTuber_gui
-99999'er atom counter bug m(  // for some unknown reason code was commented out... "gremlins"?
-densities up to 999999 can now be stored in pdb files 

#filter
+filterByDens: filters by voxel density values 
+deleteRectangleInside: deletes voxles inside the defined rectangle  //Experimental not yet testet

#readPDB
-bugfixes, lots of... do not parse pdb files by column in future *GRML*

#postgroup
+detected cavities can now be devided into subcavities with postgroupcavities.py
